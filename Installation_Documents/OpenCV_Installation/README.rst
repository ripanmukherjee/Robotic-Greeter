OpenCV Installation
*********************
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision library with bindings for C++, Python, and Java. It is used for a wide range of applications, including medical image analysis, stitching street view images, surveillance video, detecting and recognizing faces, tracking moving objects, extracting 3D models, and much more. OpenCV can take advantage of multi-core processing and features GPU acceleration for real-time operation.

OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. OpenCV-Python uses of NumPy, a highly optimized library for numerical operations with a MATLAB-style syntax. All the OpenCV array structures are converted to and from NumPy arrays.
