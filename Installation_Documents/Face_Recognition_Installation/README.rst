Face Recognition Installation
********************************
The Face Recognition library is widely known around the web for being the world's simplest facial recognition API for Python and the command line, and the best of all is that you won't need to pay a dime for it, the project is open-source, so if you have some development knowledge and you can build a library from scratch, you will surely know how to work with this library.

To build our face recognition system, we will perform face detection, extract face embeddings from each face using deep learning, train a face recognition model on the embeddings, and finally recognize faces in both images and video streams with OpenCV.

Pre-Requisites
----------------
•	A system running on Windows/Ubuntu APP/Ubuntu OS
•	A user account with sudo/administration privileges
•	Access to a terminal window/command-line

Before continuing with this tutorial, make sure you are logged in as root or a user with sudo/administration privileges.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to install Face Recognition on Windows and Ubuntu.

1.	Install Face Recognition on Windows
2.	Install Face Recognition on Ubuntu APP (Windows 10) or Ubuntu OS
3.	Install Face Recognition on PyCharm

If you are working on the Windows system, please follow step 1, step 2, and step 3, but if you are working on Ubuntu OS, you follow only step 2 and step 3.
