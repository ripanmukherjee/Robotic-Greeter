PyGame & PyAudio Installation
********************************
PyGame is a Python wrapper for the SDL library, which stands for Simple Direct Media Layer. SDL provides cross-platform access to your system’s underlying multimedia hardware components, such as sound, video, mouse, keyboard, and joystick. PyGame started life as a replacement for the stalled PySDL project. The cross-platform nature of both SDL and PyGame means you can write games and costly multimedia Python programs for every platform that supports them!

PyAudio provides bindings for Port Audio, the cross-platform audio I/O library. You can use PyAudio to play and record audio on a variety of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and Mac. With PyAudio, playing audio is done by writing to a Stream.
