Speech Recognition Installation
**********************************
Speech Recognition, as the name suggests, refers to automatic recognition of human speech. Speech Recognition is one of the most essential tasks in the domain of human-computer interaction. If you have ever interacted with Alexa or have ever ordered Siri to complete a task, you have already experienced Speech Recognition.

Speech Recognition has various applications ranging from automatic transcription of speech data (like voice mails) to interacting with robots via speech.

gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) is a Python library with Google Translate text-to-speech API. This package writes spoken mp3 data to a file, a file-like object for further audio manipulation, or stdout. It features flexible pre-processing and tokenizing, as well as automatic retrieval of supported languages.

Play sound on Python is easy. There are several modules that can play a sound file. These solutions are cross platform (Windows, Mac, Linux). The main difference is in the ease of use and supported file formats. All of them should work with Python 3. The audio file should be in the same directory as your python program unless you specify a path.
