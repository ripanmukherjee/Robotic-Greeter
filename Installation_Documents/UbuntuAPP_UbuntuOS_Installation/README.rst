Ubuntu APP & Ubuntu OS Installation
***************************************
Ubuntu is a popular operating system that is open source and has easy installation. It is quite flexible thanks to its unlimited customization options, and it highly secure. For many developers, the journey on Linux begins at Ubuntu, which is why today, we will give you a tutorial on how to install Ubuntu OS along with Windows 10 and how to install Ubuntu APP on Windows 10.

Pre-Requisites
----------------
Following are the pre-requirements of Ubuntu LTS installation:

•	Connect your machine to a power source
•	Make sure that you have enough space in your disk, i.e., a minimum of 5GB
•	You must have the version of Ubuntu you want to install in a USB drive
•	Have a backup of your data

There are two ways you can install Ubuntu as follows:

1.	Install Ubuntu OS alongside Windows 10 [dual-boot]
2.	Install Ubuntu APP on Windows 10 [Single-boot]

Note: Remember that Ubuntu APP does not have all the features as Ubuntu OS, such as zenity (GNOME). Hence Ubuntu OS or any Linux OS is better to use for this project.
