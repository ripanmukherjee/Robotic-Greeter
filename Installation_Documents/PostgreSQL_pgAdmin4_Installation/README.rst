PostgreSQL & pgAdmin4 Installation
*************************************
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. PostgreSQL is available in all Ubuntu versions by default. However, Ubuntu "snapshots" a specific version of PostgreSQL that is supported throughout the lifetime of that Ubuntu version. Other versions of PostgreSQL are available through the PostgreSQL apt repository. You can also download and install it on Windows 10.
