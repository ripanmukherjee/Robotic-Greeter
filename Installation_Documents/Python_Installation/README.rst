Python Installation
**********************
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

Python is a popular programming language often used to write scripts for operating systems. It is versatile enough for use in web development and app design. In this project, we have used Python 3.7, and hence we need to install and verify it.

This tutorial will guide you through the steps required to install Python 3.7 on Windows and Ubuntu. The same instructions apply for Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/20.04 or Ubuntu APP and any other Ubuntu-based distribution, Linux Mint and Elementary OS.

Pre-Requisites
-------------------
•	A system running on Windows/Ubuntu APP/Ubuntu OS
•	A user account with sudo/administration privileges
•	Access to a terminal window/command-line

Before continuing with this tutorial, make sure you are logged in as root or a user with sudo/administration privileges.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to install Python on Windows and Ubuntu.

1.	Install Python on Windows
2.	Install Python on Ubuntu APP (Windows 10) or Ubuntu OS

If you are working on the Windows system, please follow step 1 and step 2, but if you are working on Ubuntu OS, you follow only step 2.
